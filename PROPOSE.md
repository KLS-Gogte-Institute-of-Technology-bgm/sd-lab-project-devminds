# Restaurant Table Reservation System 
Restaurant Booking System is a convenient self-service table booking system on a web application. The aim of the project is to develop a web app where a customer can reserve a table in a selected restaurant of his choice. This allows the customer to reserve a table by selecting the number of people and the time slot. During the reservation process the customer will have to login with his credentials or will have to create a new account. The customer can also get to know about the specialities of the restaurant and a short description of it.
