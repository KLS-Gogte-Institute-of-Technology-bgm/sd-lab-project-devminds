# Restaurant Table Reservation System - Project Synopsis
***
### PURPOSE
Nowadays it has become common for fine dining restaurants to offer table reservations (booking) to their customers. In fact, this service has become an integral part of a restaurant’s operation, because of its multiple benefits and features. Even though there are still types of restaurants that prefer the modality of first-come, first served, the majority of fine dining and casual restaurants organize their operation through table reservations. As it has become part of restaurants’ service to offer reservations, customers are tending more and more towards making use of this offer, and for some people, it has become mandatory to make a table reservation before going out to a restaurant since there are also benefits for the customer in this type of service.

### SCOPE
The scope of this project is that a customer will always benefit from being able to make a table reservation at the restaurant he wishes to go. The majority of people prefer to go out knowing that they have a reservation, instead of incurring the risk of not getting a table at the desired restaurant. A clear benefit of making a table reservation for customers is the security that they will experience when going out to a restaurant. Making a reservation will guarantee the customer that he will receive his table at the time and place he has planned. It will be an advantage for the customer to know in advance that he will not have to go through the trouble of waiting until a table is available, or being put on a waiting list, or in the worst case, needing to find another place to eat, because the one chosen won’t be able to serve him.

### NON - FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS :
* Performance: For example Response Time, utilization etc.
*	Presentation: Online site should look more attractive and pleasant, often promoting confidence in use.
*	Reliability: The down time of the site should be limited to only that of the server.
*	Scalability: Search system should fetch results within the acceptable time limit.
*	Navigation: System should be easy to use and navigate through.

### IMPLEMENTATION  DETAILS

*	BRIEF OVERVIEW OF TECHNOLOGY USED :
*	Front end: 
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
1.	HTML : HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages and describes the structure of a Web page.
2.	CSS : CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.
3.	BOOTSTRAP :  Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. 

*	Back end: 
PHP, MySQL
1.	PHP: PHP is a recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
2.	MySQL: MySQL is a database, widely used for accessing querying, updating, and managing data in databases.

*	SOFTWARE TOOLS USED :
*	XAMPP SERVER :
XAMPP stands for Apache + MariaDB + PHP + Perl, indicating that this abbreviation is a recursive acronym. It is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server possible.

*	VS CODE EDITOR :
Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows. It is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle.

*	PHPMYADMIN :
phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web. It supports a wide range of operations on MySQL and MariaDB. Frequently used operations can be performed via the user interface, while we still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.  It has become one of the most popular MySQL administration tools, especially for web hosting services.
